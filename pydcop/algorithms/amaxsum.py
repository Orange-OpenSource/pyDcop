MaxSum: Belief-propagation DCOP algorithm
-----------------------------------------

Implementation of the MaxSum algorithm

We try to make as few assumption on the way the algorithm is run,
and especially on the distribution of variables and factor on agents.
In particular, we do not force here a factor and a variable to belong to
the same agent and thus variables and factors are implemented completely
independently.
To run the Algorithm, factor and variable must be distributed on agents (
who will 'run' them).
