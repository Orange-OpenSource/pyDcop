SyncBB: Synchronous Branch and Bound
------------------------------------

Synchronous Branch and Bound (SBB or SyncBB) :cite:`hirayama_distributed_1997` is
a complete search DCOP algorithm that simply simulates
Branch and Bound in a distributed environment. It was initially defined
in :cite:`hirayama_distributed_1997` for distributed constraints satisfaction
problems  but is easily extended to optimization problems, as it is done here.

During execution of SyncBB,
a *Current Partial Assignment* (CPA) is exchanged as a token among
the agents according to the ordering until a solution is found.
The algorithm is synchronous and sequential, only the agent holding the CPA can work
(all other agents are idle),
which make SyncBB slow.

In SyncBB, the CPA is represented as a path, whose elements consist of
a variable, the value for that variable and the cost incurred by that value.
For example in the path ``[ (A, 2, 0), (B, 3, 4) ]``,
the variable ``A`` takes the value 2 and ``B`` the value 3, which causes a cost of 4.
Along with this path, agents also send the currently known upper-bound
(notice that some article consider the upper bound to be broadcasted,
but that is not necessary as it can be passed in the messages with the path.)

At start, the first agent in the ordering assigns it first value and send the resulting
path to the next agent.
Each agent extends the path it by adding its value assignment to  it,
as well as the cost it incurred because of constraints with other assignments
appearing in the received path.
Whenever reaching the last agent of the ordering,
the path contains a full assignment, whose cost can be evaluated and might be used
as a new upper-bound.

When the domain of the first agent is exhausted, the last discovered full assignment is
reported as the solution (this requires remembering what that assignment was).


Variables and value ordering are given in advance:

* variables are ordered as a simple chain (list)
* values in a variable's domain are also ordered


Example
^^^^^^^
::

    pydcop solve -a syncbb graph_coloring_tuto.yaml
    {
      ...
      "assignment": {
        "v1": "G",
        "v2": "G",
        "v3": "G",
        "v4": "G"
      },
      "cost": 12,
      "cycle": 0,
      "msg_count": 23,
      "msg_size": 0,
      "status": "FINISHED",
      "time": 0.022340279014315456,
      "violation": 0
    }

Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Features**

* Only supports **binary constraints** (it could easily be extended to n-ary conatraints,
  pull requests are welcome !)
* cycles reporting
* no parameters
* complete: terminates automatically (no need for ``timeout`` ``stop_cycle`` parameters.


**Notes**

* The fixed ordering of agents is based on a `ordered_graph` computation graph,
  which is simply a classical constraints graph with a lexical order on variables.
* The ordering of the values is simply the order used when building the domain of
  the variables.
* We introduce an extra message to terminate the algorithm at each agent. This messages
  is sent from the first agent (which is the only agent that can decide termination)
  and is propagated according to the ordering.
* Agent select their value when they receive a backward message that contains a better
  bound that the one they currently know. This means that an agent may select different
  value during execution but is guaranteed to have the value from the solution assignment
  at termination.
* Although SyncBB is a synchronous algorithm, we do not use the
  ``SynchronousComputationMixin`` which would make things more complicated with no
  benefits. As only one single computation is active at any given time, we can simple
  call ``new_cycle()`` everytime a computation handles a message.
