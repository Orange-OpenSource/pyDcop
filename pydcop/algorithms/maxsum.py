MaxSum: Belief-propagation DCOP algorithm
-----------------------------------------

Max-Sum :cite:`farinelli_decentralised_2008` is an incomplete inference-based DCOP
algorithm.

This is a **synchronous implementation** of Max-Sum, where messages are sent and received
in cycles. For an asynchronous implementation,
see. :ref:`A-Max-Sum<implementation_reference_algorithms_amaxsum>`


Algorithm Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**damping**
  amount of dumping [0-1]

**damping_nodes**
  nodes that apply damping to messages: "vars", "factors", "both" or "none"

**stability**
  stability detection coefficient

**noise**
  noise level for variable

**start_messages**
  nodes that initiate messages : "leafs", "leafs_vars", "all"


FIXME: add support for stop_cycle


Example
^^^^^^^

::

    pydcop solve -algo maxsum  \\
      --algo_param stop_cycle:30 \\
     -d adhoc graph_coloring_csp.yaml

FIXME: add results

See Also
