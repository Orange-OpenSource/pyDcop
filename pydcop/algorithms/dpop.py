DPOP: Dynamic Programming Optimization Protocol
-----------------------------------------------

Dynamic Programming Optimization Protocol  is an optimal,
inference-based, dcop algorithm implementing a dynamic programming procedure
in a distributed way :cite:`petcu_distributed_2004`.

DPOP works on a Pseudo-tree, which can be built using the
:ref:`distribute<pydcop_commands_distribute>` command
(and is automatically built when using the :ref:`solve<pydcop_commands_solve>` command).

This algorithm has no parameter.

    DPOP: Dynamic Programming Optimization Protocol

    When running this algorithm, the DFS tree must be already defined and the
    children, parents and pseudo-parents must be known.

    In DPOP:
    * A computation represents, and select a value for, one variable.
    * A constraint is managed (i.e. referenced) by a single computation object:
      this means that, when building the computations, each constraint must only be
      passed as argument to a single computation.
    * A constraint must always be managed by the lowest node in the DFS
      tree that the relation depends on (which is especially important for
      non-binary relation). The pseudo-tree building mechanism already
      takes care of this.


    DPOP computations support two kinds of messages:
    * UTIL message:
      sent from children to parent, contains a relation (as a
      multi-dimensional matrix) with one dimension for each variable in our
      separator.
    * VALUE messages :
      contains the value of the parent of the node and the values of all
      variables that were present in our UTIl message to our parent (that is
      to say, our separator) .


    Parameters
    ----------
     variable: Variable
        The Variable object managed by this algorithm

     parent: variable name (str)
        the parent for this node. A node has at most one parent
        but may have 0-n pseudo-parents. Pseudo parent are not given
        explicitly but can be deduced from the constraints and children
        (if the union of the constraints' scopes contains a variable that is not a
        children, it must necessarily be a pseudo-parent).
        If the variable shares a constraints with its parent (which is the
        most common case), it must be present in the relation arg.

     children: name of children variables (list of str)
        the children variables of the variable argument, in the DFS tree

     constraints: List of Constraints
        constraints managed by this computation. These
        relations will be used when calculating costs. It must
        depends on the variable arg. Unary relation are also supported.
        Remember that a relation must always be managed by the lowest node in
        the DFS tree that the relation depends on (which is especially
        important for non-binary relation).
