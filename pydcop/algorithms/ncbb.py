NCBB: No-Commitment Branch and Bound
------------------------------------

NCBB is a polynomial-space search for DCOP proposed by Chechetka and Sycara in 2006
:cite:`chechetka_no-commitment_2006`.
It is a branch and bound search algorithm with modifications for efficiency, it runs
concurrent search process in different partitions of the search phase.

NCBB defines one computation for each variable in the DCOP and,
like DPOP, runs on a pseudo-tree, which is automatically built when using the
:ref:`solve<pydcop_commands_solve>` command.

In the current implementation, which maps the original article
:cite:`chechetka_no-commitment_2006` ,
only binary constraints are supported.
According to the authors, it could be extended to n-ary constraints.

NCBB is a synchronous algorithm and is composed of two phases:
* a initialization phase, during which a global upper bound is computed
* a search phase

The only other implementation of ncbb I could find is in dcopolis,
however I'm not sure it is correct and it is not fully implemented
(see comments in empty `lowerBound` implementation)
In order to make this algorithm easier to understand, we tried to make the implmentation
as close as possible to the description of the original article.


Initialization phase:

* `VALUE` messages are propagated from top to bottom and a value is selected greedily
  for each variable, starting from the root and based on ancestors values
* The leafs compute an upper bound, which is also propagated upwards in the tree as
`COST` messages
At the end of this phase, each variable has an upper-bound for the sub-tree rooted here.


Search phase:

Main:
* update context
* search
* subtree search
* send stop (1->)

update context:
* agents
  * receive values msg from their ancestors (->2)
    * send lower_bound to their ancestors (3->)
  * receive search msg from their ancestors (->4)
    * update their upper bound
  * receive stop message (->1)

Search:
* start subtree search
* receives costs from children
* send cost to parent

Subtree search:
 * send value to descendants (2->)
 * receive costs from descendants (->3)
 * send search to child, with upper-bound (4->)
